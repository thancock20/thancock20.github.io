Well, I finally have a site up and running, complete with a projects page and a blog.

The site is built on the awesome static site engine [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I decided to use it rather than any of the ones built on Node for a few reasons.

1. Jekyll is currently the most popular static site engine, and I would possibly need to learn how to customize it at some point, anyway.
2. Jekyll is the official engine of Github Pages, which is where this site is hosted.
3. I already had Ruby, Bundler, etc. on my system from when I was learning Rails last year.
4. I don't want to pigeonhole myself into only building sites on Node, even though that is what I am concentrating on at the moment.

So I installed Jekyll, grabbed [the Shiori theme](http://ellekasai.github.io/shiori/), and customized it to my liking. I also added several static pages, since the theme was mainly made for blogging. I'm using [Formspree](http://formspree.io) for the contact form, and [Disqus](https://disqus.com) for comments.

At some point, I will likely write a longer post about building the site. For now, I'm just happy to have it here.
